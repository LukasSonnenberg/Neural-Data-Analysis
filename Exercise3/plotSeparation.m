function plotSeparation(b, mu, Sigma, priors, assignment, varargin)
% Plot cluster separation by projecting on LDA axes
%   plotSeparation(b, mu, Sigma, priors, assignment) visualizes the cluster
%   separation by projecting the data on the LDA axis for each pair of
%   clusters. Each column is normalized such that the left (i.e. first)
%   cluster has zero mean and unit variances. The LDA axis is estimated
%   from the model.
